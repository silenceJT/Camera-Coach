- All logs, feedback data, and analytics cleared
- Privacy settings reset to defaults
- No crashes or data corruption

## ‚ö° **Performance & Stability Testing**

### **Test Scenario 4: Thermal Management Under Load**
**Objective**: Test sustained camera use on iPhone 17 Pro

**Steps:**
1. Ensure device is at room temperature
2. Launch Camera Coach with face detection enabled
3. Point at multi-face scenario (2-4 faces)
4. Keep camera active for 15 minutes continuously
5. Monitor performance metrics in debug mode
6. Note any thermal throttling or FPS degradation
7. Verify graceful degradation, not hard failures

**Expected Results:**
- Sustained ‚â•24fps for first 10 minutes
- Graceful thermal throttling when device heats up
- No crashes or hard freezes
- Proper thermal state logging

### **Test Scenario 5: Vision Framework Error Recovery**
**Objective**: Test robustness against Vision framework failures

**Steps:**
1. Enable face detection
2. Point camera at extreme conditions:
   - Very low light scenarios
   - Very bright backlit scenarios
   - Rapid movement/shaking
   - Extreme close-up faces
   - Very distant faces
3. Monitor error recovery logs
4. Simulate memory pressure (open many apps)
5. Return to Camera Coach and test recovery

**Expected Results:**
- Vision errors logged with context (thermal state, error count)
- Graceful fallback to horizon guidance on errors
- Automatic recovery after error conditions resolve
- No cascade failures or infinite error loops

### **Test Scenario 6: Multi-Face Performance on iPhone 17 Pro**
**Objective**: Validate optimized performance with multiple faces

**Steps:**
1. Test scenarios with 1, 2, 5, and 10 faces in frame
2. Measure frame processing latency in each scenario
3. Verify group headroom calculation accuracy
4. Test camera area coordinate mapping precision
5. Verify letterboxed 4:3 view performance
6. Test rapid face count changes (people entering/leaving)

**Expected Results:**
- p95 processing latency ‚â§80ms for all scenarios
- Group headroom calculation adds <5ms overhead
- Smooth transitions between individual/group strategies
- Accurate coordinate mapping within camera bounds

## üìä **UI/UX Validation**

### **Test Scenario 7: Privacy Settings User Experience**
**Objective**: Validate intuitive privacy controls

**Steps:**
1. Navigate through all privacy settings sections
2. Read all privacy descriptions in both EN/CN languages
3. Test toggle responsiveness and visual feedback
4. Test delete confirmation flow
5. Verify settings persistence across app restarts
6. Test accessibility with VoiceOver (if enabled)

**Expected Results:**
- Clear, concise privacy explanations
- Immediate visual feedback on setting changes
- Proper Chinese localization for CN users
- Settings persist correctly across sessions

### **Test Scenario 8: iPhone 17 Pro Specific Features**
