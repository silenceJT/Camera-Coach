- **HUD Overlay**: Single hint display with haptic feedback
- **Strategic Feedback**: Non-intrusive micro-survey with EN/CN localization
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular consent with on-device processing defaults
- **Thermal Management**: Dynamic performance degradation
- **Memory Optimization**: Pressure-aware multi-face detection (10→5→3→1)

### Performance Targets Met ✅
- **Frame Processing**: p95 latency ≤80ms @ 720p ✅
- **Sustained FPS**: ≥24fps with thermal fallback from 30fps ✅
- **Guidance Rate**: ≤2 prompts/second global, ≤3 per type/10sec ✅
- **Stability Window**: 300ms minimum before hint changes ✅
- **Cooldown Period**: 600ms per guidance rule type ✅

### Test Infrastructure Operational ✅
- **10 Standard Test Clips**: All scenario types validated ✅
- **Replay Harness**: Deterministic testing framework ✅
- **Regression Detection**: Performance baseline established ✅
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Complete telemetry event tracking ✅

## Next Phase: Week 6 External Testing

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Build Upload**: Archive and upload Week 6 build to TestFlight
2. **Beta Tester Recruitment**: Begin recruiting 20-30 external testers
3. **Dashboard Activation**: Initialize real-time analytics monitoring
4. **7-Day Testing**: Execute comprehensive external beta testing

### Week 6 Success Scenarios

**PASS (All Criteria Met)**:
- Proceed to Week 7-8: Advanced guidance features (orientation, lead space)
- Begin threshold tuning based on real-world beta feedback
- Prepare for broader external testing in Week 9-10

**NEEDS ITERATION (Any Criteria Failed)**:
